Odin-recipes

This is the first project I am completing. 

The goal is to build a small multi page website including a home page and multiple recipe pages. It will utilize only basic HTML and will develop my skills in basic website design ensuring I have retained what I have learnt so far. 

Further it will serve to be used in a further project later in my learning journey.

This project will serve to demonstrate a understanding of HTML and git fundamentals.
